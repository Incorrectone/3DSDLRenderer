# Basic C++ SDL2 project

This project is a basic C++ [SDL2][SDL] project that uses [CMake][] as a build system.

To build either run the shell scripts in the order configure -> build -> run, or just run all.sh once.

## Dependencies

- [Git][]
- C/C++ Compiler (gcc, g++, ...)
- [CMake][]
- [SDL2.30][SDL] library

**On Debian/Ubuntu based distributions, use the following command:**

```sh
sudo apt install git build-essential pkg-config cmake cmake-data libsdl2-dev
```
<!--
**Optional packages:**

- [SDL2_image][] library
- [SDL2_ttf][] library
- [SDL2_net][] library
- [SDL2_mixer][] library
- [SDL2_gfx][] library

```sh
sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev
```
-->

## Build instructions

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Incorrectone/SDLProject.git
cd SDLProject

# Create a build folder
mkdir build
cd build

# Build
cmake -S ..
make

# Run
./Renderer
```
<!--

***Note:*** To use SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_net, SDL2_mixer or SDL2_gfx, you
should uncomment some instructions in the CMakeLists.txt file and re-execute
the `make` command.

### Open the project with an IDE under Linux
